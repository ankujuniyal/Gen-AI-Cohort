It is expressed in square units, such as square meters, square centimeters, or square inches.\n\n**Formula to Find the Area of a Rectangle:**\n\nThe formula to find the area of a rectangle is:\n\n```\nArea = Length × Width\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* Length is the horizontal distance of the rectangle measured from one side to its opposite side.\n* Width is the vertical distance of the rectangle measured from one side to its opposite side.\n\n**Steps to Find the Area of a Rectangle:**\n\n1. **Identify the length and width:** Determine the length and width of the rectangle in the provided measurements.\n2. **Multiply length and width:** Multiply the length by the width to find the area.\n3. **Express in square units:** The final answer should be expressed in appropriate square units, such as square meters or square inches.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nFind the area of a rectangle that has a length of 5 meters and a width of 3 meters.\n\n* Length = 5 meters\n* Width = 3 meters\n\n**Solution:**\n\n```\nArea = Length × Width\nArea = 5 meters × 3 meters\nArea = 15 square meters\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nFind the area of a rectangle that has a length of 10 centimeters and a width of 6 centimeters.\n\n* Length = 10 centimeters\n* Width = 6 centimeters\n\n**Solution:**\n\n```\nArea = Length × Width\nArea = 10 centimeters × 6 centimeters\nArea = 60 square centimeters\n```\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* If the rectangle is a square, its length and width are equal, so the area formula becomes Area = Side × Side.\n* The units of length and width must be the same in order to express the result in the correct square units.\n* Area is a scalar quantity, meaning it has only magnitude (size). It does not have a direction."

Python provides several methods to achieve this:\n\n**1. `+` Operator:**\n\nThe `+` operator directly concatenates two lists, creating a new list with the elements of both lists combined:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\nlist3 = list1 + list2\nprint(list3)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n**2. `extend()` Method:**\n\nThe `extend()` method appends the elements of one list to the end of another list, modifying the original list:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\nlist1.extend(list2)\nprint(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n**3. `list.append()` Method:**\n\nSimilar to `extend()`, the `append()` method appends a single element to the end of the list. However, you must append each element individually:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nfor element in [4, 5, 6]:\n    list1.append(element)\nprint(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n**Choosing the Right Method:**\n\n* Use the `+` operator for quick concatenation of two or more lists.\n* Use `extend()` to append the elements of one list to another without creating a new list.\n* Use `list.append()` if you need to append individual elements sequentially."
