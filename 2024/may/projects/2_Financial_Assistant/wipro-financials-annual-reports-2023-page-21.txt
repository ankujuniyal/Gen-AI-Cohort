My Dear Stakeholders,
I am happy to share that in FY23 our revenue crossed
$11 billion, a growth of 11.5% YoY in constant currency
terms. This makes it our second consecutive year of
double-digit growth since we began our transformation
journey in 2020. The Board approved a buyback for the
value of `120 billion ($1.5 billion) at the price of `445 per
equity share. This is the biggest buyback in Wipro’s history.
We were tested this year by a difficult global
macro-economic environment. Even as the pandemic
receded, the Ukraine conflict entered a second year and the
global interest rates stayed high. While technology adoption
as a whole remained secular, in the second half of FY23,
we saw some re-prioritization–more cost optimization and
less discretionary spending–particularly in sectors like BFSI
and technology.
Our efficiency and growth-focused solutions allowed us to
respond quickly and pertinently to these developments.
We ended the year with strong bookings, a growth of 28%
from last year, and hired 22,000 Next-Gen Associates
(or freshers, as we called them earlier), our highest for a
single year.
This year, as in the previous one, we made several major
strategic investments, added new capabilities, and grew
our talent to support future growth. We brought together
Wipro’s entire cloud capability under a fully integrated
global business line (GBL) called Wipro FullStride Cloud,
which accounts for more than a third of our Company’s
revenue. We acquired Rizing, a global SAP consulting firm,
and made significant hires in our cybersecurity practice,
helping us create industry-leading applications. On April 1,
2023, we reorganized ourselves into four global business
lines–FullStride Cloud, Enterprise Futuring, Engineering
Edge, and Consulting–to help us align more strongly with
our clients’ priorities and drive growth in our strategic areas.
